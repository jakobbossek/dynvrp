\usage{
plotNetworkFancy(instance, time.resolution, tours = NULL, init.tours = NULL,
  customers.by.era = TRUE, highlight.depots = TRUE,
  desaturate.nonvisited = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{instance}{[\code{Network}]\cr
Network.}

\item{time.resolution}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
Time resolution used by \code{\link{dynamicVRPEMOA}}.}

\item{tours}{[\code{list}]\cr
List of lists of integer vectors. Each top.level list represents an era
and the second-level lists contain the tours of the vehicles.}

\item{init.tours}{[\code{list}]\cr
See documentation of \code{tours} for the structure. Contains for each
era to depict the tours already traveled by the vehicles until the
beginning of the corresponding era.}

\item{customers.by.era}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Colour customers by the era they arrived at?
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{highlight.depots}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Show start and end depot as large white circles with black border?
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{desaturate.nonvisited}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
This one is experimental.
Shall non-visited customers by depicted with reduced opacity?
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
