This repository contains the implementation of a dynamic evolutionary multi-objective algorithm for a bi-objective orienteering where the goal is to minimize the length of the tour traveled by a single vehicle and maximize the number of dynamic customer requests which arrive as time passes by.

## Previous work

In previous work we developed and studied an a posteriori version of the EMOA where all dynamic requests were known in advance.

## Contact

Please address questions and missing features about the **ecr** to the author Jakob Bossek <j.bossek@gmail.com>. Found some nasty bugs? Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jakobbossek/dynvrp/issues) for this. Pay attention to explain the problem as good as possible.
